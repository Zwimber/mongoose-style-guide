# Node.js Mongoose Style Guide

This is a guide for writing consistent and aesthetically pleasing mongoose models.
It is inspired by what is popular within the community, and flavored with some
personal opinions.

The style-guide style is largely based on [this style-guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide) and assumes knowledge of it.
